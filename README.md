# task-board-hw

## Description 
This is a one page application that helps the user organize their task list and mark it in to-do, in progress, or done sections. When you open the page, you can click an "Add Task" button which opens a prompt to fill out the title of the task, the due date, and the descripton. When you click "Add Task", it will first be put in the "To Do" area and will be displayed as either white, yellow or red depending on if it is an upcoming, current, or past due task. Then you can drag and drop the tasks individually to the different areas and then delete them when done! This is a great way to organize your projects!
